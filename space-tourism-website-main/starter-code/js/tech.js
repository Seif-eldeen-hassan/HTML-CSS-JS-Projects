Based in the famous Cape Canaveral, our<br> spaceport is ideally situated to take advantage of the Earthâ€™s<br> rotation for launch.","A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a<br> blunt-body reentry capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere<br> without wings. Our capsule is where you'll spend your time<br> during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, and plenty of<br> other activities to keep you entertained."]
